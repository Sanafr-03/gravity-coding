# Redesign of Gravity Coding Website – Skillsvarz 1.0 Hackathon  
 
Welcome to **Gravity Coding** — a futuristic, space-themed, interactive learning platform for developers.   
Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this frontend only project was created as part of a hackathon to showcase creativity, animation, and responsive design without any frameworks. 
 
Problem Statement -- 
A complete revamp of the website with a modern, interactive, and user friendly interface. The redesign should focus on enhancing navigation, improving accessibility, and integrating engaging micro-interactions that make learning and browsing more enjoyable. The use of smooth transitions, gamified elements, and an intuitive course discovery system will add uniqueness to the platform.
